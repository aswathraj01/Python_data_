Assignment 4

1.You are given a list that contains integers. You need to print the elements of the list with a space between them.
Input: arr[] = [54, 43, 2, 1, 5]
Output: 54 43 2 1 5
Explanation: Just traverse and print the numbers.

2.You are given a list that contains integers. You need to return the sum of the list.
Input: arr = [54, 43, 2, 1, 5]
Output: 105
Explanation: Just sum it 54 + 43 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 105.

3.You are given three inputs a, b, c. You need to create a list and append a, b, c to the list and then return that list.

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 1 2 3
Explanation: Just create a list and append 1 2 3 to it. Then return [1,2,3] list.

4. You are given a list arr that contains integers. You need to return average of the non negative integers.

Input: arr = [-12, 8, -7, 6, 12, -9, 14]
Output: avg = 10.0
Explanation: The non negative numbers are 8 6 12 14. The sum is 8+6+12+14 = 40, Average = 40/4 = 10.0

5. Given a number n, check if the number is perfect or not. A number is said to be perfect if sum of all its factors excluding the number itself is equal to the number.

Examples 
Input: n = 6
Output: true 
Explanation: Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. Excluding 6 their sum is 6 which is equal to n itself. So, it's a Perfect Number.

Input: n = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10. Excluding 10 their sum is 8 which is not equal to n itself. So, it's not a Perfect Number.

Input: n = 15
Output: false
Explanation: Factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15. Excluding 15 their sum is 9 which is not equal to n itself. So, it's not a Perfect Number.

6. Create a nested dictionary and access it’s elements

9.Write a function to print the frequency of each digit in a number.

10.Write a function that reverses the words in a sentence.

11.Write a function that finds the second largest number in a list.
